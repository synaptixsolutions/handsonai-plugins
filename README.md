## Installation

### Add the marketplace

Register this marketplace so your tool knows where to find plugins. You only need to do this once.

**Claude Code / Cursor / VS Code:**

```
/plugin marketplace add jamesgray-ai/handsonai-plugins
```

**Cowork:** Click **+** > **Add plugins...** > **Add by URL** and enter `https://github.com/jamesgray-ai/handsonai-plugins.git`

### Install a plugin

```
/plugin install business-first-ai@handsonai
```

Replace `business-first-ai` with any plugin name from the table above.

## Transparency & Security

Every file in this repository is **plain-text Markdown** — there is no compiled code, no executable scripts, and no hidden logic. You can read exactly what instructions your AI receives before you install anything.

These plugins contain only Markdown instruction files. There are no MCP servers, no external network calls, and no code execution beyond what your AI tool provides natively.

> [!CAUTION]
> Anthropic recommends reviewing any plugin before installing it: *"Make sure you trust a plugin before installing it. Anthropic does not control what files or software are included in plugins and cannot verify that they work as intended."*
