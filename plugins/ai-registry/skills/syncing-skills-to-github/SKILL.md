# Syncing Skills to GitHub

**⚡ This skill runs in Claude Code with access to your terminal and git credentials.**

## Purpose
Sync Claude Agent Skills from `~/.claude/skills/` (local machine) to GitHub repository `jamesgray007/agent-skills` with detailed commit history and automated Notion tracking. Skills are stored in a flat directory structure. Part 2 of the two-skill export→sync workflow.

## When to Use
Trigger this skill after:
- Exporting skills from cloud to local (using `exporting-skills-from-claude`)
- Creating/updating skills locally
- Weekly batch sync of multiple skills
- Any changes to skills in `~/.claude/skills/`

## How It Works
1. **Detect** changes in `~/.claude/skills/` using git status
2. **Review** what changed (new files, modifications, deletions)
3. **Identify** affected skill directories
4. **Generate** semantic commit messages based on changes
5. **Commit** to local git repository
6. **Push** to GitHub remote
7. **Update** Notion AI Building Blocks database with GitHub URLs
8. **Report** summary of sync operation

## Prerequisites

### Environment
- **Claude Code** running in terminal (has access to git credentials)
- Git installed and configured with GitHub authentication
- Repository `~/.claude/skills/` is a git repository
- Remote: `git@github.com:jamesgray007/agent-skills.git` or `https://github.com/jamesgray007/agent-skills.git`

### Notion
- AI Building Blocks database ID: `2d5edcfd-b924-80cf-a0a0-000ba0164e40`
- Notion API access configured

### Directory Structure
```
~/.claude/skills/
├── .git/                          # Git repository
├── README.md                      # Auto-generated skill index
├── generate-readme.sh             # Script to regenerate README
├── aggregating-post-performance/

├── syncing-skills-to-github/
├── writing-launch-email-sequence/
├── writing-linkedin-posts/
├── writing-substack-posts/
└── [other skills...]
```

## Implementation

### Step 1: Verify Git Repository

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills

# Check if this is a git repo
if [ ! -d .git ]; then
    echo "❌ Not a git repository. Initialize first:"
    echo "  cd ~/.claude/skills"
    echo "  git init"
    echo "  git remote add origin git@github.com:jamesgray007/agent-skills.git"
    exit 1
fi

# Check remote
git remote -v
```

### Step 2: Detect Changes

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills

# Get status
git status --porcelain

# Parse output:
# M  = Modified file
# A  = Added file (staged)
# D  = Deleted file
# ?? = Untracked file
# R  = Renamed file

# Examples:
# ?? exporting-skills-from-claude/SKILL.md   → New skill
# M  writing-linkedin-posts/SKILL.md         → Updated skill
# D  old-skill/SKILL.md                      → Deleted skill
```

### Step 3: Identify Affected Skills

```bash
# Parse git status to identify which skill directories changed
# Extract skill-name from file paths

# Example logic:
git status --porcelain | \
  grep -E "SKILL.md|references/" | \
  sed 's|^...||' | \
  cut -d'/' -f1 | \
  sort -u

# Output: List of skill-name paths with changes
# e.g., writing-linkedin-posts, syncing-skills-to-github
```

### Step 4: Generate Commit Message

**Single Skill:**
```
[CREATE|UPDATE|FIX] skill-name: Brief description

- What changed specifically
- Why this change was made
- Impact or benefit
```

**Multiple Skills:**
```
[SYNC] Updated N skills

New skills:
- skill-a: Description
- skill-b: Description

Updated skills:
- skill-c: What changed
- skill-d: What changed

Deleted skills:
- skill-e: Reason for removal
```

**Semantic Prefixes:**
- `[CREATE]` - New skill added
- `[UPDATE]` - Existing skill modified
- `[FIX]` - Bug fix or correction
- `[REFACTOR]` - Code improvement, no functionality change
- `[DOCS]` - Documentation updates only
- `[SYNC]` - Batch commit of multiple changes
- `[RETIRE]` - Skill archived/deprecated

### Step 5: Stage and Commit

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Or stage specific skill
git add skill-name/

# Commit with generated message
git commit -m "$COMMIT_MESSAGE"

# Verify commit
git log -1 --oneline
```

### Step 6: Push to GitHub

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills

# Push to main branch
git push origin main

# If push fails (e.g., branch diverged), handle appropriately
# Option 1: Pull and merge
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main

# Option 2: Force push (use with caution)
# git push --force origin main
```

### Step 7: Update Notion AI Building Blocks

For each skill that was synced, update the GitHub URL in Notion.

**Instructions for Claude Code:**

For each changed skill directory (e.g., "exporting-skills-from-claude"):

1. **Search for the skill in Notion AI Building Blocks:**
   - Use tool: `Notion:notion-search`
   - Parameters:
     - `query`: The skill directory name (e.g., "exporting-skills-from-claude")
     - `data_source_url`: "collection://2d5edcfd-b924-80cf-a0a0-000ba0164e40"

2. **Extract the page ID from search results:**
   - Check if results array has at least one item
   - Get `page_id` from first result: `results[0].id`

3. **Build the GitHub URL:**
   - Format: `https://github.com/jamesgray007/agent-skills/tree/main/{skill-name}`
   - Example: `https://github.com/jamesgray007/agent-skills/tree/main/exporting-skills-from-claude`

4. **Update the Notion page:**
   - Use tool: `Notion:notion-update-page`
   - Parameters:
     ```json
     {
       "data": {
         "command": "update_properties",
         "page_id": "[page_id from step 2]",
         "properties": {
           "GitHub": "[github_url from step 3]",
           "Status": "Deployed"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

5. **Handle errors:**
   - If skill not found in search: Log warning "⚠️ {skill-name} not found in AI Building Blocks"
   - If update fails: Log error with details
   - Continue with next skill regardless

**Example execution:**
```
Skill: syncing-skills-to-github

1. Search: Notion:notion-search
   → Found page_id: 2e1edcfd-b924-811a-99b7-c1d4724722fa

2. GitHub URL: https://github.com/jamesgray007/agent-skills/tree/main/syncing-skills-to-github

3. Update: Notion:notion-update-page
   → Updated GitHub URL ✓
   → Set Status to "Deployed" ✓

Result: ✅ Notion updated successfully
```

### Step 8: Generate README.md

Auto-generate an index of all skills.

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills

# Run the README generation script
./generate-readme.sh

# This script:
# - Scans all skill folders
# - Extracts skill descriptions from SKILL.md frontmatter
# - Generates a formatted README with a single table

# Stage and commit README
git add README.md
git commit -m "[DOCS] Update README with skill index"
git push origin main
```

## Error Handling

### Scenario: Not in Git Repository

```
❌ Error: ~/.claude/skills is not a git repository

To fix:
1. cd ~/.claude/skills
2. git init
3. git remote add origin git@github.com:jamesgray007/agent-skills.git
4. git add .
5. git commit -m "[INIT] Initial skill repository"
6. git push -u origin main
```

### Scenario: Push Fails (Diverged Branches)

```
❌ Error: Push rejected (branch diverged)

This means the remote has commits you don't have locally.

Options:
A) Pull and rebase (recommended)
B) Pull and merge
C) Force push (⚠️  destructive)

Which would you like?
```

**If user chooses A:**
```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main
```

### Scenario: Merge Conflicts

```
❌ Error: Merge conflicts detected

Conflicts in:
- writing-linkedin-posts/SKILL.md

You need to resolve these manually:
1. Open the file in your editor
2. Look for <<<<<<< HEAD markers
3. Resolve conflicts
4. git add writing-linkedin-posts/SKILL.md
5. git rebase --continue
6. git push origin main

Would you like me to show the conflicts?
```

### Scenario: Notion Update Fails

```
⚠️  Warning: GitHub sync succeeded but Notion update failed

Skills synced to GitHub: 3
Notion updates failed: 1
- exporting-skills-from-claude (not found in AI Building Blocks)

GitHub URL: https://github.com/jamesgray007/agent-skills

Would you like to register the missing skill in Notion?
```

### Scenario: No Changes Detected

```
ℹ️  No changes detected in ~/.claude/skills/

Everything is already synced to GitHub.

Last sync: 2026-01-12 14:30:45
Last commit: abc123f "[UPDATE] writing-linkedin-posts: Added hooks"
```

## Best Practices

### Commit Hygiene
- **Atomic commits:** One logical change per commit when possible
- **Descriptive messages:** Always explain WHY, not just WHAT
- **Consistent prefixes:** Use [CREATE], [UPDATE], [FIX], etc.
- **Link to issues:** Reference Notion pages or issues if relevant

### Sync Frequency
- **After each skill creation:** Immediate sync
- **After bulk updates:** Daily or end-of-day sync
- **Weekly review:** Sunday planning session
- **Before major changes:** Commit current state first

### Branch Strategy
**Recommendation: Simple main-only**
- All skills committed to `main` branch
- No feature branches (skills are standalone)
- Use tags for milestones: `v1.0-stable-2026-01`

**Alternative: Development branch**
```
main         → Production-ready skills
development  → Testing/in-progress skills
```

### Notion Integration
- **Always update Notion** after GitHub sync
- **Keep Status field current:** "Deployed" when synced
- **Track Last edited time** automatically (set by Notion)
- **Maintain GitHub URLs** for easy reference

## Integration Points

### With exporting-skills-from-claude
This skill is **Part 2** of the workflow:
1. Part 1: Export cloud → local (Claude Desktop)
2. Part 2: Local → GitHub (Claude Code) ← **This skill**

**Complete workflow:**
```
Claude.ai (/mnt/skills/user/)
    ↓ [Export]
Local (~/.claude/skills/)
    ↓ [Sync] ← This skill
GitHub (github.com/jamesgray007/agent-skills)
    ↓ [Update URLs]
Notion (AI Building Blocks database)
```

### With Notion AI Building Blocks
After successful GitHub sync:
- Updates GitHub property with URL
- Sets Status to "Deployed"
- Last edited time automatically updated by Notion

### With Business Process Guides
Skills synced to GitHub can be:
- Referenced in process documentation
- Shared with team members (if applicable)
- Included in client deliverables (if applicable)
- Version-controlled for auditing

## Security & Privacy

### Private Repository
- Repository `jamesgray007/agent-skills` is **private**
- No public access without explicit sharing
- Contains proprietary business workflows
- Protected by GitHub authentication

### No Sensitive Data
- Never commit API keys or credentials
- Use placeholder data in examples
- Sanitize client information
- Review diff before committing

### Git Credentials
- Claude Code uses your existing git credentials
- SSH keys or HTTPS tokens from your environment
- No credentials stored in skill itself

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Daily Workflow - Create and Sync New Skill

**Morning (Claude.ai):**
```
User: Create a skill for aggregating HubSpot metrics for weekly reviews

Claude: [Creates skill in Claude.ai]
[Skill saved to /mnt/skills/user/hubspot-metrics-aggregation/]
[Registered in Notion AI Building Blocks]
```

**End of Day (Claude Desktop):**
```
User: Export the hubspot-metrics-aggregation skill

Claude: [Exports to ~/.claude/skills/hubspot-metrics-aggregation/]
✅ Exported successfully
```

**End of Day (Claude Code - terminal):**
```
