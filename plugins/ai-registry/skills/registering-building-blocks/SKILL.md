# Registering AI Building Blocks

After creating, packaging, or updating any AI building block — Skill, Agent, Prompt, or Context MD — register or update it in the AI Building Blocks database.

## Asset Type Resolution

Determine the asset type from the user's request before extracting metadata.

| Asset Type | Source Location | Identifier File | Name Source |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Skill | `~/.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` | `SKILL.md` frontmatter `name` field | Frontmatter `name` |
| Agent | `.claude/agents/{name}.md` or `~/.claude/agents/{name}.md` | Agent `.md` file frontmatter or filename | Filename (without `.md`) or frontmatter |
| Prompt | User-specified file or inline text | N/A | User-provided name |
| Context MD | `CLAUDE.md` or user-specified file | N/A | User-provided name or filename |

**Resolution rules:**

1. **Keywords in the user request** — "register this skill", "add this agent", "track this prompt", "register this context MD"
2. **File path patterns** — `SKILL.md` → Skill; `.claude/agents/*.md` → Agent; `CLAUDE.md` → Context MD
3. **If ambiguous** — Ask the user which asset type to use

## Database Reference

- **Data Source ID**: `2d5edcfd-b924-80cf-a0a0-000ba0164e40`
- **Data Source URL**: `collection://2d5edcfd-b924-80cf-a0a0-000ba0164e40`

## Schema

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Name | title | Building block name (from frontmatter, filename, or user input) |
| Description | text | Description (from frontmatter or user input — includes trigger phrases for skills) |
| Asset Type | select | "Skill", "Agent", "Prompt", or "Context MD" |
| Platform | select | Always "Claude" for Claude building blocks |
| Quick Start Prompt | text | Copy-paste prompt that demonstrates the building block |
| GitHub | url | Repository URL if applicable |

## Process

For **each building block** being registered:

### Step 1: Extract Metadata

Based on the resolved asset type, read metadata from the appropriate source:

- **Skill** — Read `SKILL.md` frontmatter for `name` and `description`
- **Agent** — Read the agent `.md` file for name (filename or frontmatter) and description (opening paragraph or frontmatter)
- **Prompt** — Get name and description from the user or from the prompt file's content
- **Context MD** — Get name and description from the user; optionally summarize the file's purpose

### Step 2: Generate Quick Start Prompt

Create a single, copy-paste-ready prompt that demonstrates the building block's primary use case.

**Guidelines for Quick Start Prompts:**
- One sentence that triggers the building block's main workflow
- Specific enough to be immediately useful
- Generic enough to work across different contexts
- Should produce a complete result, not just start a conversation

**Examples by asset type:**

| Type | Name | Quick Start Prompt |
|------|------|--------------------|
| Skill | reviewing-student-goals | "Navigate to my Maven course Reflect: Goals page and extract all student learning goals. Update each student's record in Notion and give me a cohort theme analysis." |
| Skill | writing-linkedin-posts | "Write a LinkedIn post about [topic] using my brand voice." |
| Agent | playbook-question-answerer | "Answer the question 'What are the six AI building blocks?' using the Hands-on AI site content." |
| Agent | hbr-editor | "Review this article for HBR publication quality and give me prescriptive feedback." |
| Prompt | meeting-prep-quick | "Prepare me for my meeting with [name] at [company] tomorrow." |

**Context MDs** typically don't need a Quick Start Prompt — leave blank or ask the user.

**If unsure**: Ask James for the Quick Start Prompt rather than guessing.

### Step 3: Search for Existing Entry

Search the data source for the **exact building block name**:

```json
{
  "query": "<building-block-name>",
  "data_source_url": "collection://2d5edcfd-b924-80cf-a0a0-000ba0164e40"
}
```

**Critical**: Check search results carefully. A match exists only if a result has the **exact same title** as the building block name. Partial matches or similar names are NOT duplicates.

### Step 4: Create or Update

**If exact match found** → Update the existing page:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "page_id": "<page-id-from-search>",
    "command": "update_properties",
    "properties": {
      "Description": "<description>",
      "Quick Start Prompt": "<generated-quick-start-prompt>"
    }
  }
}
```

**If no exact match** → Create new entry:

```json
{
  "parent": {"data_source_id": "2d5edcfd-b924-80cf-a0a0-000ba0164e40"},
  "pages": [{
    "properties": {
      "Name": "<building-block-name>",
      "Description": "<description>",
      "Asset Type": "<Skill|Agent|Prompt|Context MD>",
      "Platform": "Claude",
      "Quick Start Prompt": "<generated-quick-start-prompt>"
    }
  }]
}
```

## Batch Registration

When registering multiple building blocks (which can mix asset types):
1. Search for **each building block individually** before any creates/updates
2. Build two lists: items to update (with page IDs) and items to create
3. For each item, generate or request a Quick Start Prompt
4. Perform updates first, then batch create new entries
5. Report results: X created, Y updated (broken down by asset type)

## Notes

- Always confirm registration with the user after modifying Notion
- If the building block has a GitHub repository, include the URL in the **GitHub** property
- Never create entries without first checking for duplicates
- If you can't determine an appropriate Quick Start Prompt, ask James for one
