# Analyzing Workflows

Analyze concrete opportunities where AI can improve your workflows. Produces a categorized opportunity report with a summary table, detailed opportunity cards, and a structured workflow candidate list.

## Workflow

### Fast Path

If the user arrives with pre-identified workflows (e.g., "I already know I want to automate X, Y, and Z"), skip Steps 1-2. Go straight to Step 3 (Opportunity Analysis & Report) using what they've provided, then Step 4 (Workflow Candidate Summary).

### Standard Path

Work through four steps in order:

#### Step 1 — Memory & History Scan

Before asking any questions, review everything you already know about the user from conversation history, memory, project files, or any other available context.

Identify and list:
- Their role, responsibilities, and domain
- Recurring tasks or requests they perform
- Pain points, frustrations, or bottlenecks they've mentioned
- Workflows or processes they've described or demonstrated
- Tools and platforms they use regularly
- Any goals or priorities they've shared

Present your findings as a brief summary so the user can confirm or correct them before continuing. If you have no prior context, say so and move directly to Step 2.

#### Step 2 — Targeted Discovery Interview

Based on gaps in your understanding (or starting from scratch), ask focused questions to build a complete picture. Cover these areas:

1. **Role & responsibilities** — What is your role? What are you accountable for?
2. **Repetitive tasks** — What tasks do you perform daily or weekly that feel repetitive, tedious, or low-value?
3. **Information synthesis** — Where do you spend time gathering, combining, or making sense of information from multiple sources?
4. **Multi-step processes** — What workflows involve multiple handoffs, approvals, or sequential steps?
5. **Quality & consistency** — Where do errors, inconsistencies, or quality issues tend to creep in?
6. **Communication overhead** — What recurring communications (status updates, reports, summaries) take more time than they should?
7. **Decision-making** — What decisions require you to weigh multiple factors or reference past precedents?

**Adaptive ordering:** Start with the areas where Step 1 revealed the least. Skip areas already well-covered by the memory scan — no need to re-ask what you already know.

Ask these questions **one at a time** — not as a list. Use the user's answers to ask smart follow-up questions. Probe for concrete examples: "I spend 30 minutes every Monday formatting a status report from three Jira boards" is far more useful than "I do reporting."

**Handling vague answers:** If the user gives vague responses after 2-3 probes on a topic, move on. If answers are vague across all areas, shift to hypothesis mode: "Based on your role, I'd guess you spend time on X — is that right?" Propose specific scenarios for the user to react to.

**Transition signal:** When you've identified 3+ concrete opportunities, tell the user: "I've identified [N] opportunities so far. I have enough to put together the report — do you want to add anything else, or should I go ahead?" Let them add more or confirm before proceeding.

Continue until you can identify at least 3 concrete opportunities — typically 5-10 questions, fewer if the memory scan provided strong context.

#### Step 3 — Opportunity Analysis & Report

Once you can identify at least 3 concrete, specific opportunities with enough detail to fill the card format below, produce the structured report.

#### Step 4 — Workflow Candidate Summary

After presenting the full report, ask the user to pick their top workflow candidates — the ones they want to build. Once they've chosen, produce a **Workflow Candidate Summary** with structured metadata for each candidate:

For each candidate:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Workflow** | 2-4 word noun phrase, Title Case |
| **Description** | One sentence describing what this workflow does |
| **Trigger** | What kicks off this workflow — an event, schedule, or request |
| **Deliverable** | The tangible output — what gets produced, sent, or decided |
| **Category** | Deterministic Workflow / Collaborative AI / Autonomous Agent |
| **Pain point** | What's slow, error-prone, or manual today |
| **AI opportunity** | Specific description of what AI would do |
| **Frequency** | Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Ad-hoc |
| **Priority** | High / Medium / Low |
| **Reasoning** | Why this priority level — based on impact, frequency, and feasibility |

Append this summary to the output file under a `## Workflow Candidate Summary` heading. Recommend which candidate to deconstruct first, with reasoning.

## Output

Write the report to `outputs/ai-opportunity-report.md`. Create the `outputs/` directory if it doesn't exist. If the file already exists, rename the existing file to `ai-opportunity-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (using today's date) before writing the new one.

The report must include (in this order):

### Report Header

| | |
|---|---|
| **Name** | [User's name if known, otherwise omit row] |
| **Role** | [Role and domain] |
| **Date** | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| **Opportunities identified** | [count] |
| **Top recommendation** | [#1 priority opportunity + one-sentence reason] |

### Summary Table

| # | Opportunity | Category | Impact |
|---|------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | [Name] | Deterministic Workflow / Collaborative AI / Autonomous Agent | High / Medium / Low |

### Top Recommendations

List the top 3 opportunities in priority order with a one-sentence rationale for each.

### Detailed Opportunity Cards

Group cards by category. Within each category, order from highest to lowest impact.

For each opportunity:

---

**[#] [Opportunity Name]**

**Category:** Deterministic Workflow | Collaborative AI | Autonomous Agent

**Why it's a good candidate:**
[What characteristics make this well-suited for AI — repetitive, pattern-based, language-heavy, clear inputs/outputs, etc.]

**Current pain point:**
[What's slow, error-prone, inconsistent, or draining about how this is done today]

**How AI helps:**
[Specific, concrete description — what AI takes as input, what it produces, how it fits into the workflow]

**Getting started:**
[A practical, low-effort first step achievable this week]

### Workflow Candidate Summary

(Appended after user selects candidates — see Step 4 format above)

### Appendix: Category Definitions

Use these definitions when categorizing:

- **Deterministic Workflow**: A repeatable process with clear inputs, rules, and outputs that AI can execute reliably with minimal supervision. Examples: formatting reports, processing forms, generating routine communications, data transformation.
- **Collaborative AI**: Human and AI work together in real time. The human drives the process; AI contributes suggestions, drafts, analysis, or feedback. Examples: co-writing, brainstorming, code review, data analysis.
- **Autonomous Agent**: A goal-driven workflow where AI plans and executes steps autonomously. The agent reasons about what to do, calls tools as needed, and adapts its approach. Ranges from a single agent handling a complex task to multi-agent systems where specialized agents coordinate across steps. Examples: competitor monitoring and alerting, research → analysis → report pipelines, intake → triage → routing systems.

## Guidelines

- Ask one question at a time — never present a wall of questions
- Use a conversational flow — let answers guide follow-up questions naturally
- Push for concrete examples over vague descriptions
- Be specific in recommendations: "AI could draft the weekly status email from your Jira board data" beats "AI could help with reporting"
- Scope each workflow candidate to one person's trigger-to-deliverable flow. If a workflow spans multiple people, note the cross-team dependencies in the opportunity card but keep the candidate focused on a single owner's scope.
- After writing the report, ask the user to pick their candidates for Step 4. Once they've chosen, append the Workflow Candidate Summary and tell the user: "Opportunity report and workflow candidates saved to `outputs/ai-opportunity-report.md`. Pick a candidate and start the Deconstruct step to break it down."
